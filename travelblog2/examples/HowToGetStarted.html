<h1>How to get started</h1>

<p>I get it, you don't know how to start your own travel blog! You don't even know where to begin! For first time bloggers, it can be a very confusing experience, and even more so on where you want to start your journey! Below are some tips I have for people just like you.</p>

<br>
	
<h3>Where do you want to go?</h3>
<p>Choosing where you want to go is always a good first step in starting a travel blog! Whether its Europe, North America, or Asia, narrowing down your choices will help you get started.</p>

<br>

<h3>What do you want to do?</h3>
<p>This can go hand in hand with the last step, but identifying what you want to do on your adventure can help you choose where you want to go and to show people what you are doing.</p>

<br> 

<h3>How are you going to get there?</h3>
<p>It is very important you make a plan on how to get where you are going, where you are staying, etc.! This can be the difference between a really nice vacation or an awful vacation! Some websites, such as <a href="https://www.trivago.com/" target="_blank">Trivago</a>, <a href="https://www.expedia.com/?langid=1033&semcid=US.B.GOOGLE.BT-c-EN.GENERIC&semdtl=a111416148122.b1117302372808.r1.g1kwd-12670071.i1.d1474093018635.e1c.j19060556.k1.f1.n1.l1g.h1e.m1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzOqKBhAWEiwArQGwaFn7H2s8fRCHygDIkZ2RHrgpOzcnQoOqBmUHZo8k95Pr83WQWo0B_xoC17EQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Expedia</a>, or even <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> can offer much needed advice and deals to get you where you want to go! </p>
